  "overview": "This guide takes you through the process of building a basic version of SQLite, one of the most widely used database engines. You'll explore SQL syntax, understand SQLite's file format, dive into the mechanics of B-trees, and learn how data is stored and queried efficiently. By the end of the project, you will have implemented key features of a simple database engine.",
